Step by step\nDownload and prepare data file in .csv format\nCreating the divergent bar chart\nCreating dot-and-line chart for confidence levels\nCreating the dashboard\n\nE. Main Observations\n\nA. Critic\nA critic of the following data visualization is provided.\n\nClarity\nS/N\nCritique\nSuggestion\n1\nThe y-axis on both charts do not follow the same sorting i.e. the stacked bar chart is sorted by alphabetical order on the y-axis while the bar chart on the right is sorted by descending percentage on the x-axis. Some readers may overlook this and assume that the bars in the same row belong to the same country in both charts.\nCreate parameter to allow users to select whether to sort by alphabetical or proportion agree, in ascending or descending orders. Ensure that this parameter is applied to all relevant charts for easy cross-reference.\n2\nDemographics data such as age and gender are not reflected in the charts; these demographics data are important to provide further insights into the willingness of the public on Covid-19 vaccination (as trends may surface based on these factors).\nCreate parameter to allow users to select their category of choice (country, age, gender etc) to view the responses accordingly. Ensure that this parameter is applied to all relevant charts for easy cross-reference.\n3\nThe title of the 100% stacked bar chart, Which country is more pro-vacinne? does not provide any insights as to how the responses were collected.\nShow in the visualization the survey question that respondents answered i.e. If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.\n4\nThe visualization provided does not state how the data is collected i.e. respondents answered one question of a public survey. Furthermore, Vac 1 in the legend on the right does not indicate what the question is.\nInsert a title “Public Survey on Covid-19 Vaccination”.\nInsert more questions and their responses; create parameter to allow users to select the question they want to view the responses for.\n5\nConfidence levels in the survey responses are not reflected in the visualization. Confidence levels are important to show how representative is the survey of the general population.\nShow error bars with a selector on confidence levels, 95% and 99%.\nAesthetics\nS/N\nCritique\nSuggestion\n6\nVaccine is incorrectly spelled as “Vacinne” in the title for the 100% stacked bar chart.\nUse the correct spelling.\n7\nIn the 100% stacked bar chart, five different colors is used to represent each response, making comparing distribution of responses difficult for the reader.\nInstead, responses should be color-coded to three main sentiments - agree, neutral and disagree, and further differentiated by shades of the same color within the same sentiments.\n8\nWhile the stacked bar chart retains the part-to-whole nature of the data, it does not efficiently show the split between positive and negative responses.\nUse diverging bar chart to allow readers to see the general shapes of agree and disagree. Complemented with three main colors, it is easy to see whether the sum of agree is greater than the sum of disagree for each question.\n9\nThe x-axis of both charts have different end points and their major tick marks have different decimal places.\nFormat both charts to have the same start and end points, and the number formats with the same decimal places.\nB. Alternative Graphical Representation - Sketch\nasdfghjl insert sketch here\nAdditional enhancements\nC. Proposed Dashboard created on Tableau\n\nD. Step by step\nDownload and prepare data file in .csv format\nGo to https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker and download the zip file.\nOnce the .zip file is downloaded, extract the files and go to the data folder.\nIn Microsoft Excel, create a new workbook, insert the following column headers to each column, save as data-merge.csv.\nColumn\nColumn Header\nA\nCountry\nB\nRecordNo\nC\nendtime\nD\nage\nE\ngender\nF\nemployment_status\nG\nvac_1\nH\nvac2_1\nI\nvac2_2\nJ\nvac2_3\nK\nvac2_6\nL\nvac_3\n\nGo to the data folder, open australia.csv. (If it is in a .zip file, then extract the zip file. You will see the .csv file after the extraction.)\nSelect Row 1, go to vac_3 and filter for responses that is not blank.\n\nGo to vac_1, vac2_1, vac2_3, vac2_6 and uncheck any blanks.\n\nCopy and paste the records from the 12 columns from australia.csv to data-merge.csv. Do not copy the header.\n\nFor some countries, employment_status is not one column. Instead, you will see 7 columns related to employment_status. To arrive at the corresponding employment_status, first create a new column named employment_status then conduct a vlookup.\nCreate a new column named employment_status.\n\nCreate a new tab called key and insert the key table into cells A1 to B8, as shown below.\n\nNext, go back to the newly created employment_status column, and insert the vlookup formula.\n\nThe formula in Cell CG1 for employment_status is\n\nDrag and fill the formula down to all records.\nContinue with Step 5 above.\n\n\nRepeat steps 4 - 5 for the .csv files for all other countries. Once you have completed the above for all countries, save your data-merge.csv file to a local folder. Your final data-merge.csv should have 40,083 records.\nImporting and Preparing the data in Tableau\nOpen Tableau. Drag and drop your data-merge.csv file to Tableau.\n\nGo to Sheet1 at the bottom of your screen.\nFrom the Data pane, drag Endtime to Filters. In the pop up, select Years and click Next.\n\nSince we only want to include responses from 1 Jan 2021 onwards, we check 2021 and uncheck the other values. Click OK.\nTo ensure that this filter applies to all the worksheets that we create on Tableau, right click on Endtime in the filters pane, go to Apply to Worksheets > AllUsingRelatedDataSources.\n\nIn the Data pane, right click on Age.

Clearing the selection will Show all values.\n\nThe above action will result in the Gender and Age(group) stacked bar charts to change accordingly when a selection is made in the diverging bar chart.\nThe dashboard is now completed (available on Tableau).\n\nE. Main Observations\nThe proportion of respondents that are worried about getting Covid-19 do not vary much across gender, age or employment status. However, varying levels of concern are apparent when comparing responses by country. Japan, Spain and South Korea are the top three countries with more than 50% of respondents in these countries worrying about getting Covid-19.\n\nI am worried about getting Covid-19.\n\n\nDespite Japan ranking the highest for worrying about getting Covid-19, Japanese respondents are unwilling to take the vaccine should it be available to them this week.\nIn Japan, 30% of respondents disagreed to taking the vaccine if it were made available to them this week.Japan also has the highest proportion of respondents that are worried about the side effects of the vaccine.\n\nWith regards to confidence in the government, Denmark and United Kingdom are leading at 73% and 69% of total respondents respectively that agree with the statement below.\n\nI believe government health authorities in my country will provide me with an effective Covid-19 vaccine.\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the same countries that were most worried about getting Covid-19 also have less belief in their government health authorities to provide an effective Covid-19 vaccine, namely South Korea and Japan.\nDespite Singapore having greater confidence in their government health authorities than other countries, respondents from Singapore are less likely than other countries to take the vaccine should it be available to them this week.\n\nIf a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.\n\nVaccine interests is higher in those aged 50 and above, with more than 50% of respondents keen to take the vaccine if it were available to them this week.\n",

Three Major Observations\n\nA. Critic\nA critic of the following data visualization is provided.\nExcerpt and chart taken from Page 22 of Report: Labour Force in Singapore 2019Clarity\nC1. Trends in the first four sentences of the statement are not immediately apparent in the visualization. In particular, the age groups aged 55 and above and aged 25 to 54 in the statement have not been grouped in the visualization.\nC2. The years in between 2009 and 2019 are missed out; only 2009 and 2019 are shown. A comparison of two years can be one-sided. The years in between must be shown to reflect trend and add meaning.\nC3. Y-axis is missing from the visualization.\nC4. No lead in or callouts to provide context.\nC5. Title and statement of visualization are misleading; Per Cent is inaccurate.\nC6. LFPR is used in the statement, without stating what LFPR stands for.\nC7. LFPR trends are not shown in the chart despite being mentioned in the statement.\nC8. Chart Title Resident labour force by age is not accurate; instead, “Resident labour force by age group” is more accurate.\nAesthetics\nA1. Poor color choice of gray and blue used; the shaded tables are difficult to read.\nA2. X-axis labels are cramped.\nA3. Poor positioning of Source and Note, with less than one line space between them and no spacing below Note.\nA4. Per Cent, which is placed below the chart title, is positioned too far away from the line graph and will likely be overlooked by the reader.\nB. Alternative Graphical Representation - Sketch\nWith reference to A. Critic, an alternative representation is sketched below.\n\nTwo charts, with chart title, are added. (C5, C8)\nChart 1: Labour force participation rate (%)\nChart 2: Distribution of labour force\nIn both charts, data points range every year from 2009 to 2019 (instead of showing only 2009 and 2019) to reflect trend. (C4)\nData is grouped into three and four age groups in Chart 1 and Chart 2 respectively. The grouping allows for more meaningful data visualization and trend observations. (C1)\nChart 1 is a line chart that shows the labour force participation rate (LFPR) by age group by year. This will reflect the trends in LFPR, in particular the sustained increase in LFPR for the cohorts aged 55 and above. (C1, C7)\n65 and above years\n55 - 64 years\n25 - 54 years\n15 - 24 years\n\nChart 2 is an area chart that shows three age groups and their proportion of the labour force each year. This chart serves to reflect the increase in proportion of residents aged 55 and over in the labour force over the years. (C1)\n55+ years\n25 - 54 years\n15 - 24 years\n\nIn Chart 2, the values for proportion of labour force of each age group, in 2009 and 2019, are labelled to emphasis the corresponding trend described in the statement. (C1,C4)\nEach line and area is clearly labelled with the age group. (C1, C2)\nColour palette, Tableau 10, is chosen to differentiate the age groups clearly; instead of grey-blue colour for 2009 and 2019 respectively. Colours across the charts are consistent i.e. same age group, same color, to reduce miscommunication. (A1)\nY-axes with minimum 0% and maximum 100% are shown on both charts. (C3, A4)\nX-axis labels and x-axis title are comfortably spaced i.e. not cramped on both charts. (A2)\nSource is positioned two line spaces below the x-axes; Source is also aligned left and in different front from x-axis labels (for differentiation). (A3)\nLabour force participating rate is stated in the statement to reflect what LFPR stands for. (C6)\nMedian working age in 2019 and 2009 are shown as an annotation on Chart 2. (C1)\nCallouts are added in the line chart, indicating the increase in labour force participation rates of age groups 55 - 64 years and 65 & over years, from 2009 to 2019. (C4)\nBlank spaces are purposefully added in the visualization e.g. between the two charts, to increase neatness overall. (A2)\nC. Proposed Data Visualization - Tableau\nAvailable for download on Tableau Public hereD. Step-by-Step Guide for Creating the Visualization\nD.1 Preparing the data in excel\nFirst, we download the following two tables from Table: Labour Force 2019.\nTable (5): Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex, 2009 - 2019 (June)\nTable (7): Resident Labour Force Aged Fifteen Years and Over by Age and Sex, 2009 – 2019 (June)\n\nFrom the data in Table 5, copy and paste the labour force participation rates of the following age groups, from years 2009 to 2019, onto another excel file. You should have three columns with 44 observations. Save file as data_LFPR.xlsx to use as your data source for Tableau.\nAge Groups\n15 - 24\n25 - 54\n55 - 64\n65 & Over\nData Columns\nColumn A: Year\nColumn B: Age Group\nColumn C: Labour Force Participation Rate\n\n\nFrom the data in Table 7, we need to calculate proportion of resident labour force of each age group, by year, in percent.\n\n\nProportion = number of residents in each age group each year divided by the total number of residents in the same year\n\n\n\nDo the same for every year and every age group. Copy and paste the values calculated onto another excel file. You should have the following three columns with 133 observations. Save file as data_labour_force.xlsx to use as your data source for Tableau\nData Columns\nColumn A: Year\nColumn B: Age (Years)\nColumn C: Percentage (i.e. the proportion of resident labour force of each age group in each year)\n\n\nD.2 Creating the line chart on Tableau\nLoad Tableau and click on Microsoft Excel from the taskbar on the left. Select the file: data_lfpr.xlsx that you have created previously. Click Open.\nClick on Abc of Year. From the dropdown, select Date. Then, go to Sheet 1.\n\nFrom the Data pane, drag Year to Columns, drag Labour Force Participation Rate to Rows, and drag Age Group to Color (in the Marks pane).\nTo show all markers for each line, click on color in the Marks pane and set Markers to all i.e. the icon showing a line with markers.\n\nFrom Columns, click on the dropdown arrow from YEAR(Year)and select Year as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nDouble click on the chart title and change it to Labour force participation rate. Set font to Tableau Book, 12, bold.\nDouble click on the x-axis and change Title from Year of Year to Year. Go to Tick Marks. Set Major Tick Marks to Fixed, Interval = 1, Unit = Years.\n\nDouble click on the y-axis and remove the Title. Set Range to Fixed start = 0, Fixed end = 100.\nRight click the y-axis and select Format. On the left pane, go to Scale > Numbers and select Number(Custom).

Update their fonts accordingly.\nTitle: Tableau Light, 16, bold\n\nShare of older residents in the labour force rose in 2019\n\nDescription: Tableau Light, 10, not bold\n\nThe labour force participation rate (LFPR) of residents has increased since 2009. The increase in LFPR was steepest for those aged 65 and above; from 2009 to 2019, their LFPR increased by 12 percentage points. The LFPR of residents aged 55 - 64 years also increased by 9 percentage points. Coupled with aging population, the proportion of residents aged 55 and above that make up our labour force rose to 25% in 2019. While the LFPR of those in the next age band 25 - 54 years increased as well, the cohorts entering this age band were smaller than those who moved out due to lower birth rates. Hence the proportion of residents aged 25 - 54 in the labour force declined from 75% in 2009 to 67% in 2019. In 2019, the median working age is 44 years.\n\nFor both Title and Description, font color (as shown below) is the same.\n\n\nFrom the Objects pane, drag and drop Blank in between your two charts.\nFrom the Objects pane, drag and drop text box to the bottom of the canvas (below both charts). A box spanning the entire width of the canvas must appear before you release your cursor.\nAn Edit Text dialog box appears. Place the Source in the box. Update the font to Tableau Light, 9, with color = same as chart title.\n\nSource: Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, Manpower Research & Statistics Department, MOM\n\nResize each pane. Reposition marker annotations and data labels accordingly. The final dashboard is shown below.\n\nE. Three Major Observations\nLabour force participation rate of residents (LFPR) aged 65 & over years has increased the most, compared to other age groups, from 2009 to 2019. Their LFPR of 29% in 2019 is also the highest in ten years.\nProportion of labour force aged 55 and above has increased by from 2009 to 2019. This suggests an aging workforce in Singapore.\nDespite the labour force participation rate for residents aged 25 - 54 years increasing over the past ten years, their proportion in our labour force has declined from 75% in 2009 to 67% in 2019.\nAside from an aging resident labour force, a greater proportion of elderly are continuing to work past the age of 65 years old and not retire earlier, despite Singapore having the Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n1.0 Overview\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\nBefore you get started, you are required:\nto start a new R project, and\nto create a new R Markdown document.\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\n\n\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\n\nfor(p in packages){library\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\n    install.packages(p)\n  }\n  library(p, character.only = T)\n}\n\n\n\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\n3.1 Importing Data\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\n\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\n\n\n\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\n\n\n\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\n\n\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\n\n\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\n\n\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
